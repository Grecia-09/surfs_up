# Surfs_up

***Overview***

An investor asked me to run some analytics on a weather dataset from the island where I would like to open my Surf n' Shake shop, especially I looked up for temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

***Results***

- When generating the summary statistics for the June temperatures DataFrame, we can see that the average temperatures hover in the low 60s to mid 80s.

Overall, there’s never a bad time to visit Oahu. The weather in the middle of the year is dry and warm, with tradewinds taking the edge off the heat. And in winter  with rain returning and temperatures dropping to as low as 56°F at night, nothing like an umbrella or a good rain-coat couldn't fix.
